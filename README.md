Cat Photos

The Cat Photos section has a link to a gallery of cat photos. The link opens a new tab, so visitors can continue browsing the website while they look at the cat photos.

Cat Lists

The Cat Lists section has two lists: things cats love and things cats hate. Each list is accompanied by an image. The list of things cats love includes catnip, laser pointers, and lasagna. The list of things cats hate includes flea treatment, thunder, and other cats.

Cat Form

The Cat Form section has a form that visitors can use to submit their cat photos. The form has three fields:

    Indoor/outdoor: This field is a radio button group that allows visitors to indicate whether their cat is an indoor or outdoor cat.
    Personality: This field is a checkbox group that allows visitors to select multiple personality traits for their cat. The available personality traits are loving, lazy, and energetic.
    Cat photo URL: This field is a text field where visitors can enter the URL of their cat photo.

When a visitor clicks the Submit button, the form data is sent to the website server. The server then processes the data and saves the cat photo to the website database.

Footer

The footer of the website has a link to freeCodeCamp.org, the organization that created the code.
